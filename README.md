# Web-Development-Tools-Methods
Covers Web Development, focusing on both the fundamentals and from them modern development practices for the web.
Javascript will be used on both the front- and back-ends of web application development. 
 - Basic git use as a version control system for shared applications and development
 - How information flows in a web application between various machines
 - Modern JS development for the frontend (both "vanilla" JS and React-based)
 - NodeJS development of a backend end, both server generated content using the express framework (minimal) and service development.
 - Web security fundamental practices, both front- and back-end.
 - The basics of how many development teams breakdown application needs and complete work
 
 ### Web Fundamentals

 - HTTP, servers/webservers, browsers, clients, URL/URI, HTTP as stateless, request/response, headers/body
 - The role of HTML, CSS, and JS
 - Semantic HTML, MDN, The Browser Wars, evergreen browsers, the unreliability of not-that-old information
 - HTML best practices, CSS best practices, JS best practices
 - Absolute vs relative paths/URLs
 - Multiple-page web applications
 - Static vs dynamic assets, client-side/server-side
 - programming languages as communication, idioms, static/dynamic languages, weak/strong typing
 - Javascript syntax, NodeJS, npm/yarn, package.json, global vs local installs, JSON
 - debugging JS, unit tests, testing pyramid, TDD
 - functions as objects, prototypes, 'this'(context), callbacks, threads, try/catch, closures, scopes
 - templates, Model-View-Controller(MVC)
 - HTTPS/SSL, public-key encryption, certificates, Authentication, Authorization
 - Password hashing/salting, JWT, SQL Injection

Build a simple multiple page web application using NodeJS that serves semantic HTML and styles with CSS. 

### The Recent Web

 - the DOM, cookies, localStorage, indexedDB
 - application state, state in model vs state in DOM
 - asynchronous events (async), Promises, XHR/fetch/AJAX, HTTP verbs (methods), REST, services/endpoints
 - polyfills, minifiers, linters, bundlers, transpilers, CSS preprocessors, builds
 - Progressive Enhancement
 - Application state management, CRUD

Able to write a simple single page web application (SPA) calling RESTful, external services, and use NodeJS to provide those service endpoints

### The Modern Web Industry

 - Frontend frameworks/libraries, React, virtual DOM, JSX, Single Page Applications (SPA)
 - props vs state, Pure components vs stateful components
 - Same Origin Policy(SOP), CORS, XSRF/CSRF, CSP, OWASP
 - as-a-service (PaaS, FaaS)
 - Agile, change management, Software Patterns
 - Mockups, wireframes, prototypes
 - Obfuscation, copyrights, and module licensing

Able to analyze provided designs to matching write a complex single page web application (SPA) and prior to actual coding identify potential problems with development due to insufficient/poor requirements.
