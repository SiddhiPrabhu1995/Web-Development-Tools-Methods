# Exam 1

* Start from the up-to-date master branch (`git checkout master; git pull origin master`)
* Create a feature branch named 'exam1' (`git checkout -b exam1`)
* Modify the `questions.md` file to have the answers required
* Add a `server.js`, a `words.js` and any other files necessary to create the multiple page web application below
* Add, commit, and push the branch to github
* Create a PR to merge to master
* Be sure to include the reviewer(s).  
* Due by 11:59pm (PT) Sun Jun 7  

## Goal and Requirements

* Did you remember the above requirement about `questions.md`?

The application will be a game to guess a word.

The User will enter a word, and the page will do one of:
* Say the word is not one of the permitted words and allow them to enter a new word
* Display that the user has correctly guessed the word and allow them to start a new game
* Say how many letters the word has in common with the word they are trying to guess, without regard to position or case-sensitivity  (See "Examples" below)

## Requirements

### Visuals
* The game will display the list of previously guessed words for this word, as well as their number of "matching" letters
* The game will display the number of accepted guesses made (turns taken, not counting invalid words)
* The game will display the list of valid words to guess
  * This list will be scrollable if it cannot fit in the space available
* The game will show effort to make it visually attractive and usable.

### Logic
* The game will use a `words.js` that exports an array of valid words.  
* The game will work if this file is replaced by a different list of words.  All words in any version of the file will be the same length as the other words in that file.
* The words.js file should ONLY export an array of valid words
  * ONLY.  Any other word logic should be in a different file.
* The game will not care about case-sensitivity.  The game will call a letter a match, even if the letter is in a different position in the word (see "Examples" below)
* The server will console.log the current secret word at the start of a game with a given game id.  The client should never know the secret word until it is guessed. 
  * Hint: the server should send a random id to the client.  The server will be able to match the id to a word, but the client should not be able to.
  * Hint: The page will have to send this same secret id to the server on every request. This can be done with a hidden input field or a query parameter.
* The game must be runnable via: `npm install` and then `node server.js` and then going to `http://localhost:3000`
* The server should work for multiple players, each playing their own games that may last different durations and are not impacted by other players.  
  * Hint: The random ids are how the servers tell the players apart - the id will have to be sent on each request.
* No information should be sent to the clients that allow them to learn the secret words they are trying to guess outside of guessing.
  * Hint: This means the secret word isn't sent to the browser

### Examples

If `words.js` has the words "TEA, EAT, TEE, PEA, PET, APE" and the game selects TEA as the secret word then:
* TREE will give a warning about an invalid word, not increment the turn counter and allow a new guess
* ATE will give a warning about an invalid word, not increment the turn counter and allow a new guess
* PET will respond with 2 matches and increment the turn counter then allow a new guess
* TEE will respond with 2 matches and increment the turn counter then allow a new guess
* tee will respond with 2 matches and increment the turn counter then allow a new guess
* EAT will respond with 3 matches and increment the turn counter then allow a new guess
* TEA will respond that they have won the game in however many turns and allow them to start a new game with a new randomly selected word from the list

## Allowances
* You may reuse files or parts of files from previous assignments - but they will be graded by the criteria here!
* You may create your HTML as you see fit, but it must be fundamentally semantically valid and other best practices from class

* You may add icons and background images but there is no requirement to do so

## Restrictions
* You should use `express` module only
* You must add additional JS files (server-side ONLY) that YOU write to uphold the idea of separation of concerns
* You must use the correct HTTP methods (GET for loading pages, POST for adding content)
* Reloading a page should not trigger a POST (use a redirect)
* Do not use external JS other than base express 
* Do not use external CSS libraries
* You may not use floats to do more than manage flowing text with images
* You may not use HTML tables or CSS table layouts
* You may NOT use client-side/browser-side Javascript
* Do not have any files in your PR except for the exam (no files from other assignments, for example)
* Do not use var

* Do not use poor or unclear variable names
* Do not have functions that are too big/do too much
* Do not have console.log messages or commented out code
